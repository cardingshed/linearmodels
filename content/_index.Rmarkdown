# Linear Statistical Modelling

## M346/M348 

M346/M348 is a third year Open University course in [linear statistical modelling](https://www.openuniversity.edu/courses/modules/m346).  This website is written entirely in R partly as a place to show off some of the functionality of R.  The aim is to find ways to highlight a few interesting ideas and help intuitive understanding ðŸ’¡ of some of the course's topics - it's not a formal introduction or textbook coverage.

Here's a [sample page](https://lm.deeprich.net/note/common-null-distributions/) which has some visible R code for the graphs - all content is available GitHub [here](https://github.com/deeprich/linearmodels)
