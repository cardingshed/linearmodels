# Linear Statistical Modelling

## M346

I am an associate lecturer on a third year mathematics undergraduate course, M346: [linear statistical modelling](https://www.openuniversity.edu/courses/modules/m346). This website is a collection of supplementary resources I am developing to help support students. My aim is to help build confidence and intuitive understanding ðŸ’¡ of each topic, rather than providing an first introduction or textbook coverage.
