Some useful links for GenStat and R

# GenStat {#genstat-link}

GenStat is published by VSNI international, who have a [quick start guide](https://genstat.kb.vsni.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/Genstat_quickstart_guide.pdf) and a selection of [tutorial videos](https://genstat.kb.vsni.co.uk/videos/) on their website.

# R {#r-link}

This website is written in R: all code used in the notes is available in R markdown (.Rmd) files on GitHub [here](https://github.com/deeprich/linearmodels/tree/main/content/note).

If you're programming using R, I would recommend the IDE **RStudio** (download from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)) and following chief scientist [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) for latest developments in the tidyverse, a collection of packages for data analysis.
