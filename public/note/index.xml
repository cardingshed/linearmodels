      <description>How to understand which distribution is used when and why it’s in that test…
Often, parameters in linear modelling can be assumed to follow a known distribution if a null-hypothesis is true, which is the justification for e.g. Wald-tests (normal), chi-squared tests, \(t\)-tests, and F-tests.
The normal, chi-squared, t and F distributions are the most commonly met as null-distributions in these tests - this is a brief guide to help build an intuitive understanding of why they arise.</description>

      <description>Looking for good \(\mu\)s? The most likely answer is the MLE!
In many real-world applications, a parametric distribution with known density \(f(x;\theta)\) where \(f\) has parameter(s) \(\theta\) is a good model for the variable of interest, \(x\). Examples:
 If \(x\) represents heights, then we might have \(f=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\biggl[-\frac{1}{2}\biggl(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\biggr)^2\biggr]\) with \(\theta\) the vector \((\mu, \sigma^2)\). If \(x\) represents a count, a Poisson distribution is often sensible \(f=\frac{\lambda^x e^{-x}}{x!}\) here \(\theta = \lambda\).</description>
